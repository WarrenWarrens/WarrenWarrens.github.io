            <p data-key="intro">I'm a developer who enjoys making cool stuff.</p>

            <p>Hey, I’m Ryan, a 4th year BSC. Computer Science student at Ontario Tech University,
                specializing in Data Science and dual minoring in Mathematics & Physics.
                Proudly Canadian, born and raised in Ontario.
                Here's what I can do for you:
                With over three years of post-secondary education, I've developed a diverse portfolio
                of languages and systems I can develop for. I can work confidently with Python, C++, C,
                Java, HTML, CSS & Dart. Through these languages, I've worked on applications and projects
                that cover databases, mobile development, website hosting, physics simulations, systems
                programming & software design. Combined with close to a decade of working experience,
                across various positions, companies, training, locations and duties. I’m not just a student
                dedicated to knowing theory, nor am I a complacent worker waiting for their next paycheck.
                I know the theory, I know how to get things done, and I know the environment for work.
                In the world of artificial intelligence, I’m proudly human, I know what it means to fail,
                and I know how to overcome those failures with work & determination.

                    Tech defines the course like so:
                    Graduates of this program will obtain a
                    solid foundation in the theory and application
                    of the principles of computer science, as well as
                    in the cognitive capabilities and skills relating
                    to computer science. This program also provides
                    the opportunity for the student to develop practical
                    capabilities and skills, such as software design and
                    implementation, information management, risk
                    assessment, effective deployment of software
                    tools and system evaluation. In addition,
                    transferable skills such as communication,
                    teamwork, self-management and professional
                    development are emphasized in many courses.

                    one of two, optional specializations CS students
                    can obtain during their BSC. Computer Science.
                    Ontario Tech defines the specialization like so:
                    The amount of data generated by, and available
                    to, companies, governments, and individuals, is
                    exploding. There is an urgent need for individuals
                    who can grapple with massive amounts of data and
                    extract key information.
                    People with these skills (often called
                    data scientists) are highly sought after
                    in a variety of industries, including health care,
                    finance, and business. The Data Science specialization
                    within the Computer Science program helps students develop
                    the knowledge, skills, and tools, and sets them up for success
                    in this desirable job market. Students develop critical
                    problem-solving, analytical, and computational skills
                    that enable them to turn vast quantities of data into insight.

                            building material into their vehicles. A few weeks later I

                            their projects. Then the following summer, I was trained on a

                            greatly increased. My new duties included, helping to unload
